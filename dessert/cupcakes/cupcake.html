  <h1>Red Velvet Cupcake</h1>

  <img class="cupcakeImage" src="../../images/cupcake.png" alt="A nice picture of a ding dang cupcake!">

  <p>A cupcake (also known as a fairy cake) is a small cake designed to be eaten by one person, baked in a thin paper
    wrapper, and decorated with frosting on top.</p>

  <p>One of the mainstays at Coffee & Cake is our famous Red Velvet Cupcake. A well-guarded recipe combined with the
    natural ingredients make this little red rascal unapologetically delicious. Topped with decorative vanilla frosting,
    the Red Velvet Cupcake is a favorite among kids as well.</p>
